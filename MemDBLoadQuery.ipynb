This has already been seen in real-world attacks, such as the Royal Mail cyber attack in 2022, where hackers used ChatGPT to craft convincing emails containing ransomware. This trend has raised concerns about the potential for AI-generated content to be used for malicious purposes, as it can bypass traditional email security measures. Additionally, the use of ChatGPT in cyber attacks has been observed by security researchers and companies, such as Kaspersky and Check Point Research, who have warned about the potential threats posed by this technology.\\n\\nMoreover, ChatGPT has the capability to generate text that is convincing to humans and can be used for social hacking, such as phishing emails.
